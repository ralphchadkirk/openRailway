            <h2>About openRailway</h2>
            <p>openRailway was first concieved by Ralph Chadkirk in early 2011. The idea of it was to provide some open-source downloadable tools for heritage railways to use to support their systems.</p>
            <p>Programming of openRailway started in December 2011, and the system currently stands in the alpha development stage.</p>
            <p>You can read more about it on the openRailway GitHub page, or you can get involved by forking our project on Git. If your modifications are liked by the development team then we may merge your fork.</p>
